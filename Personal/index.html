								<h3>Skin Lesion Classification</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>This project aims to use the benchmark dataset Ham10000 which consists of skin lesion images to conduct a statistical analysis under conditions where the dataset contains corrupt/noisy images and build models that obtains accurate results of image classification. </li>
									<li>Using noisy images in the implementation of Skin Lesion classification is important because it helps to improve the model’s robustness and generalization performance. In the real world, images of skin lesions may contain various types of noise, such as blur, distortions, artifacts, and other types of interference. </li>
									<li>By training the classification model on noisy images, we can make it more resistant to these types of noise and better able to generalize to unseen data. </li>
									<li>Pre-trained models used -  ResNet50, VGG16, DenseNet121, VGG19 and ResNet152.</li>
